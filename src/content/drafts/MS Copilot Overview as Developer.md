## The Gist
Generative AI tool such as MS Copilot can improve developer productivity up to twice as fast on certain task related to code generation, refactoring, and documentation. However, they can become a hindrance for more complex tasks.

## What it's good for
As previously suggest, this generative AI tools will shine in task related to code generation, refactoring, and documentation.

**Use Case**
- Ask question about everyday task (standard library, optimize function, etc)
- Ask to improve code quality
- Ask to spot mistake and fix it
- Ask to write repetitive code and create placeholder content
- Ask to add comment to piece of code
- Ask to help write unit test with various test case
- Ask to explain code written by someone else
- With copilot notebook, ask to help refactor code

## What it's bad for
While MS Copilot excels at many tasks, it may struggle with more complex tasks such as architectural design, understanding nuanced business logic, and making high-level strategic decisions in code development.

## Demo
(TODO)

## Alternative / What can be improved
- Integration with code editor
- [[GitHub Copilot Overview]] (itâ€™s different product)
