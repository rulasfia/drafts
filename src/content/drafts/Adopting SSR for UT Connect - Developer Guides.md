# ðŸš€ SSR Implementation

## Server-side rendering

Server-side rendering (SSR) is the process of rendering the initial HTML of a web page on the server and sending it to the client. This is done to improve the initial load time of the web page, and to improve the SEO.

## Difference with our previous model

Previously, we use CSR (Client-side rendering). We write our application in React & Typescript, then we use Vite to build & bundle the application, and finally we use Express server to serve the application to the client. In This model, our entire application code is running on the client browser. The Express server is only used to serve the static files (& generate the sitemap).

With SSR, our code is running on both the client browser and the server.
